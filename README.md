# StreamlitChallenge

The 30DaysOfStreamlit is a coding challenge that helped me to get started in building Streamlit apps. Particularly:

* Set up a coding environment for building Streamlit apps
* Build my first Streamlit app
* Learn about all the awesome input/output widgets to use for my Streamlit app
